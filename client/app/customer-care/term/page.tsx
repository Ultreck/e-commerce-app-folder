            You are responsible for reading the full product listing before purchasing a product. By confirming your purchase, you agree to pay all applicable fees, taxes, shipping costs and other amounts associated with your purchase. Further, to the extent applicable, you acknowledge that you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination.
