If you would like to receive the other items in your order ASAP, you may cancel the other longer-processing item(s) for a refund. Your remaining items can then be shipped out immediately.

             We know you're excited to get your order through and so are we! If your order arrives late, as a gesture of courtesy, we offer you a â‚¦1,600 credit (standard shipping) to your account as a small sign of appreciation for your patience.`,
